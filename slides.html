# DevOps is *not* ...

# DevOps is not...

* a role/job title ("DevOps Engineer")

 * would be an issue for collaboration and end-to-end-responsibility

* only (infrastructure) automation

 * just one aspect of many

* getting rid of ops - "NoOps"

 * as development assumes more ownership and responsibility,<br>
   *Ops is more important than ever*

* sysadmins who code

---

# DevOps is not... (Cont'd)


* DevOps teams

 * creates just another functional silo between dev and ops

 * knowledge gap

 * further concentrates responsibility

 * ownership of product?

 * basically release engineering

Dev: get innovation to users, fast → business priorities

Ops: stability, reliability, responsiveness → protect business from disruption

lack of operational mindest in development process & <br>
lack of development mindest in operational process

Common goal: make organization as productive as possible

* a mindset/philosophy

 * failures as learning opportunities

* learning culture and practice

* strategies break down silos & facilitate collaboration

* not actually "new" or revolutionary - but it does not claim to be


**Goals**

* shorter development & feedback cycles (time to marked, MTTR)

* alignment with business objectives

# The Three Ways

---

# The First Way: Systems Thinking

<div class="boxed" style="text-align: center">Business → Dev → Ops → Customer</div>

 *Improve work flow from left to right**, i.e. performance of the entire system

* lower amount of Work in Progress (WIP)

 * WIP only creates value as finished product

* faster flow will deliver value faster

* remove constraints (person, technology, culture, process)

---

# The Second Way

<div class="boxed" style="text-align: center">Business ↔ Dev ↔ Ops ↔ Customer</div>

**Enhance feedback loops from right to left**

* both number of feedback loops and speed

* stop if error is found and transmit as fast as possible to source

 * e.g. designing quality into product at earliest stage

---

# The Third Way

**Continuous experimentation and learning**

* create culture where

 * constant experimentation and learning is encouraged

 * people acknowledge that way to mastery is through repetition and practice

* take risks and learn from failures

* controlled: risk is not too big (small WIP) and fast feedback on changes

* ensuring to continually put tension into system to continually reinforce habits and improve

# Culture

* shared responsibility

* blameless post-mortem

*

---

# Automation

<div align="center">
<img src="images/devops-tools.png" style="width: 90%;"/>
</div>

---

# Automation (Cont'd)

* save time

* prevent defects

* consistency

* self-service

---

# Measurement

* track metrics and use information to drive feedback loops and objective, blameless decision making

* end-to-end visiblity for applications, infrastructure, and digital business as a whole

* helps to demonstrate to positive impact of DevOps on business

**Examples**

* Business Success: Conversion rate, avg revenue per user, customer acquisition constraints

* Customer Experience: response time of key business transactions, customer satisfaction

* Application Performance: Uptime, response times, resource utilization

* Speed: lead time for changes, frequency of releases, mean time to resolution

* Software Quality: error rates, outstanding bugs, incident severity

---

# Sharing

* exchange ideas across teams

* sharing tools, discoveries and lessons

* find people with similar needs and collaborate to elinimate duplicate work

* conference participation: motivation and information

---

template: divider

# Challenges

---

# Challenges

* share resources: making time for non-product Work

* constant context switching

* "no one can serve two masters"
