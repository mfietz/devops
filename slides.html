# DevOps is *not* ...

---

# DevOps is not...

* a role/job title ("DevOps Engineer")

 * would be an issue for collaboration and end-to-end-responsibility

* only (infrastructure) automation

 * just one aspect of many

* getting rid of ops - "NoOps"

 * as development assumes more ownership and responsibility,<br>
   *Ops is more important than ever*

* sysadmins who code

---

# DevOps is not... (Cont'd)


* DevOps teams

 * creates just another functional silo between dev and ops

 * knowledge gap

 * further concentrates responsibility

 * ownership of product?

 * basically release engineering

# DevOps is ...

> DevOps is just the agile principle, taken to the full enterprise.

<div style="text-align: right">Rosalind Radcliffe</div>

* a mindset or cultural movement

* learning culture and practice

* strategies that break down silos & facilitate collaboration

* not actually "new" or revolutionary - but it does not claim to be

* encourage ownership & accountability - "you build it, you run it"

---

# Goals

* shorter development & feedback cycles

* faster time to market

* improve  mean time to repair (MTTR)

* lower failure rates of new releases

* eliminate technical debt and unplanned work

* alignment with business objectives

# A Short History

---

# History

* 2008: Andrew Shafer posted an idea for an agile infrastructure session at the Agile 2008 Conference. <br>Only a single person, Patrick Debois, showed up.

* 2009: *10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr* presentation<br>
This inspired Patrick to create his own conference

* 2009 First DevOpsDays conference

* 2011: DevOps goes mainstream<br>Before, movement still mainly fueled by individuals and open source tools

* 2014: Large companies like Target, Nordstrom and LEGO adapt DevOps

# The Three Ways

---

# The First Way: Systems Thinking

<div class="boxed" style="text-align: center">Business → Dev → Ops → Customer</div>

 *Improve work flow from left to right*, i.e. performance of the entire system

* lower amount of Work in Progress (WIP)

 * WIP only creates value as finished product

* faster flow will deliver value faster

* remove constraints (person, technology, culture, process)

---

# The Second Way

<div class="boxed" style="text-align: center">Business ↔ Dev ↔ Ops ↔ Customer</div>

**Enhance feedback loops from right to left**

* both number of feedback loops and speed

* stop if error is found and transmit as fast as possible to source

 * e.g. designing quality into product at earliest stage

---

# The Third Way

**Continuous experimentation and learning**

* create culture where

 * constant experimentation and learning is encouraged

 * people acknowledge that way to mastery is through repetition and practice

* take risks and learn from failures

* controlled: risk is not too big (small WIP) and fast feedback on changes

* ensuring to continually put tension into system to continually reinforce habits and improve

# Culture

* shared responsibility

* blameless post-mortem

* failures as learning opportunities

* honesty and openness

* transparency

* trust

---

# Case Example: Culture at Netflix

* Encourage independent decision-making by employees

* Share information openly, broadly and deliberately

* Are extraordinarily candid with each other

* Keep only our highly effective people
 * adequate performers receive a generous severance package

* Avoid rules
 * policy for travel, entertainment, gifts, and other expenses: "act in Netflix’s best interest"
 * vacation policy: "take vacation"
 * avoid over-correcting when freedom is abused

# Automation: Goals

* save time

* prevent defects

* consistency & repeatability

* self-service

---

# Automation: Tools

<div align="center">
<img src="images/devops-tools.png" style="width: 90%;"/>
</div>

---

# Lean

* focus on identifying value streams

* eliminate waste: keeping everything minimal, yet useful; e.g.
 * small and frequent deployments
 * team size

* continuous improvement, e.g.
 * regular retrospectives
 * A/B testing

* embracing failure
 * absorb, recover, learn → anti-fragility
 * postmortems focus on where processes fell down and how to strengthen them

---

# Measurement

* track metrics and use information to drive feedback loops and objective, blameless decision making

* end-to-end visiblity for applications, infrastructure, and digital business as a whole

* helps to demonstrate to positive impact of DevOps on business

**Examples**

* Business Success: Conversion rate, avg revenue per user

* Customer Experience: response time of key business transactions, customer satisfaction

* Application Performance: Uptime, response times, resource utilization

* Speed: lead time for changes, mean time to resolution

* Software Quality: error rates, outstanding bugs

---

# Sharing

* exchange ideas across teams

* sharing tools, discoveries and lessons

* find people with similar needs and collaborate to elinimate duplicate work

* conference participation: motivation and information

---

template: divider

# Challenges

---

# Challenges

* culture change

* legacy systems & infrastructure

* tool turbulance

* cross-functional teams

 * share resources: making time for non-product Work

 * constant context switching

 * "no one can serve two masters"

* resistance to change

* process challenges: with power comes great responsibility
